[x] disable backface culling to display backoriented triangles (just use rigidobject, they are non-culled)
[x] MultiPath is using linear interpolation between keyframes. However on SO(3)

without recompiling. Delete the whole plannersetup folder!
[x] restructure GUI to use GUIVariables

[x] be able to design landscapes/fancy environments and import them to simulator
[x] be able to load different landscapes/robots from simulator, plus start/goal
configs, and be able to run different algorithms to find a solution. Then be

as swept volumes simultaneously
    [x] be able to load different landscapes + plannersettings from simulator 
    [x] screenshots

KINODYNAMIC Planning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] return only pointers in ompl_space, make a factory
[x] finalize kinodynamic space
[x] simulate jet propulsion
[x] implement tangentbundle integrator
[x] *** execute/simulate kinodynamic path (use jet propulsion)
[x] torque values are SO(3) x R3 in controller, but should be R3xSO(3).  Why?
[x] error: driver 0 is not in PID mode. Why?
[x] jet propulsion not implemented yet (see RobotJointDriver)
[x] jet propulsion acts on global coordinate frame, not locally on robot link
[x] torques not being set properly (robot should move with random torques)
[x] segfault /w single rigid body
[x] drivers and actuators do not match up. zero joints = zero actuators, therefore segfault. where are the actuators created?
[x] display the jet propulsion wrenches to verify
[x] why does robot move when disabling force fields? (does not happen after reset!)
[x] display all torques applied
[x] fix propagation function
[ ] *** do kinodynamic planning /w torque constraints on fibre bundle
  [ ] forward simulation is wrong on tangent bundle
  [ ] calcacceleration returns values on fixed joint
  [ ] feels like momentum is ignored by propagation function. 
[ ] Plan using speed profile by TOPP or Klampt
[ ] Plan one path /w speed profile using OMPL, 
[ ] send torques or pid values to controller
[ ] execute path in the simulator, have perfect path following behavior

[ ] composite force fields: intersection and union
[ ] add constraint to a FF to be inside a given rigid object

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contacts 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[x] self collisions occuring when simulating atlas in Klampt. ODERobot
correctly determines that collision occurs. But why is it not avoided? maybe
force too strong? but then terrain would be permeated, too.
  Simulation/settings.h: const static bool gRobotSelfCollisionsEnabled = true;
[x] reset not working anymore
[x] reset goes back to wrong position
[x] reset: momentum is not set back to zero 
[x] kernel panic after movie creation
[x] got another kernel panic after displaying torque based jet propulsion

[x] compute and display distance between links and terrain
[x] make small 3-leg spider robot, only contacts
[x] design cave environment
[x] force is applied even with 000 force field (didn't remove se3drivers)
[x] planning with two robot entities inner/outer SV
  [x] make cspace with two robots, inherit from kinodynamiccspace, make robot + outer shell 
[x] level planning
 [x] visualize level tree
 [x] visualize level path
 [x] visualize level all paths

way we could build a hierarchical visualization
[x] fix spider urdf
[x] install SBL lib
[x] compute homology groups (HG) of SC
[x] make bottle planning possible
[x] visualize internal holes
[x] changing between visuals changes colors/linewidth of other visuals, but shouldn't.
[x] ompl cannot deal with zero dimensions
[x] orientation limits are not respected OMPL
[ ] How to make the contact decisions inside the controller?
[ ] most important point is how the hierarchy would work with a contact point
[ ] simulate a magnetic-contact. read klampt tutorial about humanoid robot with
infinite force contact. how to selectively activate/deactivate?
[ ] how to define contact points and add arbitrary force when in contact?
[ ] how to make and break contacts
[ ] how to adapt sphere/capsule to new structure. it is completely different, how can that work?
[ ] can we design a controller which moves M0 around a great arc of an arbitrary sphere?
[ ] do the same, but for M2
[ ] solve IK for arbitrary rob-env contact points
[ ] grasp an actual object
[ ] sample grasps for object and compute IK (findGrasp method)
[ ] make/break contact events => compute transition paths
[ ] execute transition paths 
[ ] Compute Force Closure Grasp from points
[ ] Compute SE constraints, what is GIWC equivalent?

[ ] update to klampt-0.7
[ ] visualize wrench cone at contact
[ ] create pathspace which computes irreducible paths
[ ] Button to save/load GUI state including Motion Planning Equipment
[ ] Needs switch to QT, the file loader from GLUI seems not to work properly. Also the graphics are quite bad. 
[ ] have ability to retime a path inside simulator, then display the
output over time inside the simulator. 
[ ] be able to deform path inside simulator. Ability to load paths from file,
then display them, then deform them, then to save those paths. 
[ ] use TAB to access different modes: simulation <-> Desired Pose (change goal) blender-like controls?
[ ] better swept volume visualization (have an aggregate or convex hull of successive positions)
    andreas dziegielewski http://acg.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/swept-volume/project-page seems promising
[ ] making a safe static contact

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Geometric Planner 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[x] remove zero measure dimensions from OMPL (i.e. map them to lower space
before starting OMPL, there are always problems with that)
[x] have one complete system for rigid link: add arbitrary nested robots.
compute shortest paths. Iterate through all solutions.

[x] magneto: 2-dof, 2 magnet robot
[x] reset does not work on all robots
[x] remove orientation sampling for rotational invariant shapes
[x] bottle requires different planner because physics is different: innerouter vs. normal
 
[x] add drawFace/drawEdge to terrain XML file
[x] make objects transparent
[x] sometimes [two nearby paths are not reduced], investigate that (update definition of equivalence first)
[x] incorporate [sufficient conditions], visualize that nodes are feasible, use
some interpolation to get shortest path in pocket
[x] more challenging environments
[x] orientation of capsule definitely not correct. needs investigating.
[x] make a list of environments, their picture and what this environment is
designed to show (+ who came up with the environment)
[x] check if we can store personal information in a PD::Node during planning.  I.e. store sufficiency and maybe some other stuff there

[x] going up does not remove SV
[x] position goes through wall in L (uses triangle meshes and not hierarchy of
primitives -> maybe we can remove the checker from klampt?)
[x] PlannerInput -> AlgorithmInput
[x] maxplanningtime not used in algorithm
[x] visualize swath volume of onetopic covering
[x] visualize roadmap plus edges by visualizing it as a dense swath volume
[x] remove serialized tree once and for all
[x] split fibrebundles up into checker and integrator. put them into subfolders. 
[x] visualize a onetopic cover by a bunch of threads ?
[x] visualize necessary and sufficient vertices.
[x] make benchmark for november 10th containing at least 5 algorithms and 5
environments. Rigid bodies are OK for now.
[x] write dae->tri converter
[x] simplify final path and interpolate
[x] replay motion, not only swept volume (OnIdle)
[x] outsource all those individual cspaces

[x] cspace: refactor cspace into separate classes
[x] cspace: info print is horrible
[x] cspacefactory: include kcspace into cspace factor, and add string type to specify cspace type from the outside
[x] cspacefactory: refactor factory into one function, should encapsulate everything, no kcspace/cspaceompl stuff outside
[x] fix the chart boundary issue in visualizing the SE(2) roadmap
[x] path: rewrite path to use ompl representations, only convert at Eval
[x] make colors changeable from XML

[x] MultiSlice should return PRM when only fed with one slice
[x] multislice with priority queue
[x] verify for SE(3)
[x] make it multilevel
[x] collision is broken for multilevel (only first level seems to work)
[x] upper level in collision fix. did you add checker for last level!? or is it
a an issue of chart boundary overflow? -> if the latter, than make the path an
ompl path instead (would also be better for deformations)
[x] fix R3S2 issue (sublevel components are more than SE3)
[x] fix zero-measure issue (implement new connect and distance functions)
[x] move slice_naive to slice, and create new slice_? which implements some
improvements like identifying narrow passages for sampling
[x] fix chart boundary path
[x] optimize resulting path, smooth it
[x] visualize each level's solution path!
[x] show feasibility of at least one additional joint in SE(3) (three or four
level planner should be possible)
[x] solve doublelshape in some time T (show that it is indeed feasible) maybe
make hole bigger
[x] check if connect function performs as desired! (does constructSolution lie
on graph!?)
[x] enable benchmark (needs overhaul)
[x] object touched obstacles during play path with multislice in SE(3)
[x] ensure correct reset
[x] output from sql database to cout
[x] rename multislice -> QMP
[x] prettify the output graphs:
 [x] add horizontal line time-cut off
 [x] add number of runs
 [x] add seconds to time
 [x] always start at zero
 [x] visualize the solved instances divided by all
[x] extensive benchmarking for some SE(3) examples
[x] visualize all solved paths
[x] why do we get invalid paths?
[x] catch error during benchmark with multislice, created zero nodes.
[x] compare algorithms: RRTConnect, QMP (the classical, only sampling changed), QMPConnect (adjust also connect function), QMPSufficient (ignore sufficient edges), QMPNarrowPassage (analyse underlying graph structure, change sampling accordingly), QMPcsn (all together)

[x] invalid start state on Xshape -> maybe bigger problem with converting
ompl->klampt!? (nope, this should affect other planners too)
->is not reproducible, i.e. there seems some randomness (but everything up to
that point should be strictly deterministic!) ->not the right klampt dimension
returned! -> it worked for RRT because there we used GeometricCSpace instead of
SE(3)
[x] path replay stops with out of range. path replay is too fast/too slow.
[x] resulting path from RRT is not smooth (but should be smooth through shortcutting)
[x] store path as PWL path including non-smooth + plus smoothed version (remove
anything else from the roadmap class)
[x] save resulting path to file, and be able to load it back (use PWL class)
[x] add raw path to pwl
[x] rm vantage path from pathspace
[x] do comparison uniform, edge index, stoer_wagner_min_cut
[x] swept volume uses the wrong robot index (make this available directly in
path_pwl.h)
[x] identify narrow passage on graph (high priority)
[x] make button to visualize the drawPoser routines
[x] filtration involving SE3RN subspaces not working
[x] Robot Manipulator
[x] rewrite quotient_planner.h to handle specific cases (RN <-> RM, SE3 <->
SE3RN, R3 <-> SE3, etcetera, instead of trying everything)
[x] memory increases for QMP, some structures must be not cleaned up.
[x] solve hubble without objects and three layers
[x] remove sufficient edges (Priority)
[x] rename multislice -> multiquotient
[x] visualize all paths from multiquotient
[x] while path is plotted, somehow keep focus on a locus point on the robot,
i.e. some tracking ability (draw_path_autofocus="1")
[x] we need a dimmer to visualize only the spheres below a certain threshold
[x] visualize: open sets of radius below threshold (have a dimmer)
[x] sampling density should reflect the radius of the vertices, i.e. the volume
of the cover
[x] visualize: shortest path on each level
[x] sampling nearby from a gaussian distribution on SO(3) in OMPL is likely wrong,
sometimes i get an unnormalized quaternion back when i sample with a high
stddev. Look into that.
[x] remove the visualization of the bounding box for focus view
[x] do randomBounceMotion, but constrained to graph!needs probably rewrite of
expandRoadmap
[x] do not sample random edge (RE), but random node-edge (RNE). RNE samples a
node at random, and then sample an edge at random from all the incoming edges of
the node. RE has a bias
towards vertices with high in_degree, while RNE does not. It has been reported
that a hybrid approach works well, where we sample p*RNE+(1-p)*RE with p=0.8.

[x] too many random walks start at vertex 0, why is that? -> nan values in pdf
[x] visualize connectivity of roadmap components (each component different
color)
[x] benchmark should be completely describeable in xml
[x] get rid of double hierarchy construction ompl vs qmp
[x] remove algorithm / maxplanningtime etcetera from plannerinputs and put them
into separate xml file (one setting for everything)
[ ] benchmark.xml merge with planner.xml?
[ ] openGL transparency does not work correctly with the bubbles


QMP PLANNER
[x] size of bubbles ok with one layer, but changes if another layer is added (is
there some way that we might confuse the vertices when using getPlannerData?)
[ ] do some contact planning on atlas, hrp4, some spider robot and a real
complicated robot hand with 5 fingers and several revolute joints (is there some
URDF i could use?)
[ ] what does the deform require? --> definition of increasing reachability.
[ ] need nice atlas/hrp4 scenario with grasping and leg movement (climbing
step!?)


KINODYNAMIC PLANNING
[x] do bullet with kRRT
[x] do not allocate new state in propagate function
[ ] implement propagate, but never use Config
[ ] do integration via ODESolver::ODE functionality (not quite possible, the
force are coming from Klampt eventually)
[ ] understand rigid body motion in arbitrary force field. how can we simulate
the body?
[ ] do integration using force fields
[ ] rocket launch is too difficult for kompl to be solved. devise simpler experiment.
[ ] manipulation with ultra complex hand, such that QS approach will get
highlighted. Maybe even add some clutter/debris.
[ ] clip FF at O boundaries
[ ] get obstacle informations from world
[ ] think about ways to get T(X.xml)<1. 
   --- Symmetry of regions (seems to be unique to X).
   --- Critical points (CP) characterizing important boundaries of the manifold.
might be hard to compute explicitly
[ ] plan path, then play path in simulation using controller

[ ] color each planner. Have one button to execute each planner in a seperate
thread. Once finished, return the path and visualize the highest layer path in
the corresponding color of that planner.
[ ] make planner run on separate threads
[ ] it would be nice to repeat an algorithm N times, and visualize the solution paths.
[ ] more sophisticated [graph visualization]; using viewpoint to get fixed 3d position
[ ] new ViewTree to visualize a pathspace exploration
[ ] multiple restarts of RRT produce same results. reseed!
[ ] cspace: remove geometric and replace by namespace. remove cspace from filename?
[ ] base: make some generic printing, using__CLASS__, __FILE__, etcetera
[ ] simulator crash if forces are too high and selfcollision is enabled ---
happens if we apply a force which overcomes the self-collision and creates
overlapping meshes. solution: avoid forces higher than ?? or increase
self-collision forces?
[ ] reset: crash when plotting joint values
[ ] retreat simulation
 
[ ] need remove dependency to SimTestGUI so we can manipulate the unneccessary GUI
elements
[ ] enable component hotkeys (C-s,S-p)
[x] automate the OnCommand method to automatically switch/case through all
variables inside the state and toggle them.
[ ] abstract class SimTestGUI overwrites hotkey assignment, remove that
[x] robot should start at q_goal, not at q_init
[x] all torques should be applied, not only the first one
[x] torques should be applied into the relative direction, not globally
[ ] the resulting path should closely follow the geometric path
[ ] actuators should be specified together with urdf, and in relation to a
certain link (pos and direction relative to link + power)
[ ] need to have a threaded version, reading sensor, writing commands, see
SerialController.h
[ ] reset back to start position, not zero/zero

-- ompl control simulates a forward torque in relative x direction of the
object. However, in the klampt simulator, we suddenly apply a global x
direction, which leads to the unwanted behavior.

-- two main imperatives: (1) solve Xshape by introducing new geometric planner
probably based on SC. (2) solve rocket using QS

-- it seems (2) is easier to do, but (1) could be better at speeding things up,
making it really workable in the real-world. (2) is necessary to show the
generality.

(1) forward integration on manifold using OMPL/Klampt tools.
(2) application of torque to a driver using Klampt. 
(3) visualization of
application of torque to a driver (this should be read directly from drivers,
not separate)

[x] IRIS does not work correctly when obstacle bounds are outside of polyhedral
bounds (see https://github.com/rdeits/iris-distro/issues/68). 
[x] initial Xshape region not correct
[x] compute approximation of QS using iris and correct libcdd
[x] visualize 3d convex hull by using only the faces. how can we adequately
enumerate them? Is that a solved problem?
[x] active facets removal not enough, we also need to obtain which faces are
inside other regions, or near obstacles.
[x] how does CGAL compute the difference between polyhedra? Maybe we can just take the bounding box and subtract the obstacles to get the complete workspace. Then we can work with that, doing convex decompositions in some way etcetera.
[x] use OpenSCAD for building objects (awesome)
[x] load obstacles into nef_polyhedron_3, and then subtract them from
poly_bounds;
[x] compute convex decomposition
[x] make computation of free workspace independent of hardcoded files (
using OFF file format)

[x] decompose environment
[x] try decomposition with harder surfaces/meshes -> much slower as expected, what
would be a good approach there? (ignore or abstract E probably)
[ ] extract narrow passages of environment
[ ] compute topological information of environment
[ ] solve cardslot environment. Obtain 3D slot representation. How about
choosing a box at random. Then sample them at random. How about just using it
with QMP?

workspace quotient
[x] sample random points from free workspace
[x] are points sampled from surface or from inside as desired?
[ ] make colors changeable in xml
[x] use with QMPConnect as usual [not so nice, still problems in TPs]
[ ] try solving the cardslot problem using RRTConnect (20mins)
[ ] compute path towards goal. then do priority sampling along that path.
[ ] sampling has too many points near the geometric centers (since they have
higher connection probability). Change that to something more uniform.


[ ] need new approach to solving sphere-like environment



LH approximation
[ ] compute QS path. 
[ ] color LH class
[ ] repeat for several interesting environments.

Make Graph Sampler/Searcher fault-prove
[ ] Boost::Graph: Understand how bundled properties can be used on astar_search or dijkstra


[ ] QS. HasSolution. NumberOfSolutions. GetRoadmaps


First, we need to search for one solution on Q1. Once found, we can either
explore this solution, or continue searching on Q1. 


[ ] Two modes: interactive/automatic. 
  Interactive mode: 
  [ ] button for one step. Meaning one sample is drawn. Then we draw roadmap
  [x] button for moving through the explored solution classes.
  [ ] button for exploring one class for X ms. 
  Automatic mode: 
  [ ] button for computing X ms.
  [x] button for computing until solution found.
  [x] button for stepping through the currently explored roadmaps

[x] get rid completely of pathspace, replace by roadmap. levels should be
specified in advance, not as recursive chain
[ ] able to execute/smooth solution paths
